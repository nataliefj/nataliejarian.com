    				<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
    				<div class="half-width">
    					<p>I've made my home base in Hamilton, Canada, though I grew up in Australia. My journey into tech started recently, when I decided to take my career into my own hands. I have previously worked in administration and customer service - both in the construction industry. I've always been the 'techy friend' and so decided to grow in that area, into an industry that is here to stay. </p>
    				</div>
    				<div class="half-width">
    					<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

    					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
    					<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. </p>

    					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
    					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
